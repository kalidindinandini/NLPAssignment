## Sentiment Analysis Model for Pharmacautical Company 


The datasets i.e., train.csv and test.csv consists of scrapped data relating to 102 drugs and reviews for those drugs. 

I have implemented all the necessary steps required for building a Text Classifier in Python.

The core idea of building a Text Classifier involves:

* Data Analysis
This step involved analyzing the entire data using techniques, cleaning it and transforming it to bring out valuable insights.

* Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering involves creating a representation of input data using which the model can be trained better.

I have used Bag of Words Approach to create feature vectors for the input data.

Bag of Words is a representation used in Natural Language Processing in which we create a multiset of words for each training example.


* Model Selection, Training and Evaluation
In this step, firstly a model is selected based on the properties of data and then it is trained on the training sample.



### Vader Sentiment

For a given medicine, vader classified review as Positive, Negative or Neutral.


### Deep Learning Model

Used RNN and LSTM on train and test datasets for achieveing the ABSA but was unable to do so.


The assignment is not done completely. 

### Further Approach

The solution for this problem is Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis.
